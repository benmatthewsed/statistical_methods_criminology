    "text": "Who is excluded?\nFor SCJS to be a measure of crime for all adults, not just all adults in private households, we need to make a key assumption that “the subset of the adult population not captured in the SCJS experience the same level of victimisation as adults in the household resident population”​\nBut this excludes people, students, people in prison, and those living in refuges​\n“Domestic abuse is the main cause of women’s homelessness in Scotland… All women living in Women’s Aid refuges have experienced domestic abuse and many will have experienced other forms of crime”\n\nFrom Handbook chapter - falling sample size, falling response rate and falling victimization all mean less ‘power’ in more recent SCJS sweeps\n\n“The reduction in survey response rates is a phenomenon that has been observed internationally (de Leeuw, Hox and Luiten, 2018), and there are particular concerns that it is the most marginalized in society (often the most prone to victimization) who are no longer responding to surveys (Savage and Burrows, 2009). Again, taking Scotland as an example, valid response rates to the SCJS fell from 71% in 2008/09 to 63% in 2019/20 (Saunders et al, 2021), with a\nfurther reduction (following the Coronavirus pandemic) to just 47.3% in 2021/22 - the lowest response rate for any SCJS sweep since 2008/09 (Scottish Government 2023a). This issue has been compounded by reductions in the valid sample size for successive sweeps of the SCJS, which has reduced from 16,000 in 2008/09 to just 5,500 in the sweeps conducted since 2016/1714, largely in an effort to cut costs. Factoring in the large reduction in the prevalence of victimization (mentioned above), the stark reality is that the number of victims interviewed as part of the Scottish survey reduced from 2,786 in 2008/09 to just 639 in 2021/22. So, whilst the prevalence of crime fell by just over 50% (or in absolute terms, a fall of 10.4 percentage points), the number of survey respondents who had experienced at least one incident of crime has fallen by an astonishing 77%.”",
