Again, taking Scotland as an example, valid response rates to the SCJS fell from 71% in 2008/09 to 63% in 2019/20 (Saunders et al, 2021), with a urther reduction (following the Coronavirus pandemic) to just 47.3% in 2021/22 - the lowest response rate for any SCJS sweep since 2008/09 (Scottish Government 2023a). This issue has been compounded by reductions in the valid sample size for successive sweeps of the SCJS, which has reduced from 16,000 in 2008/09 to just 5,500 in the sweeps conducted since 2016/1714, largely in an effort to cut costs. Factoring in the large reduction in the prevalence of victimization (mentioned above), the stark reality is that the number of victims interviewed as part of the Scottish survey reduced from 2,786 in 2008/09 to just 639 in 2021/22. So, whilst the prevalence of crime fell by just over 50% (or in absolute terms, a fall of 10.4 percentage points), the number of survey respondents who had experienced at least one incident of crime has fallen by an astonishing 77%.”\nYou need to evaluate how useful a data source is in the context of your particular research question. e.g. you might be able to make an overall assessment of victimization for some social group but not look at a trend for that group, whilst you can look at trends for other groups. I guess this is curse of dimensionality. Or you might need a different model for some groups versus others/have to assume more.",

It may bias your regression coefficients, meaning that your results are valid and in reality there is a stronger association between predictor and outcome that you have observed.

Even with such information, however, concerns about generalization across studies must be addressed by considering how differences between the study populations may have affected response and selection.\n\n\nConfounding\nThere’s something that we know affects the outcome we’re interested in and/or our independent variables, but we don’t have a measure for this. In criminology, we might have measures of police stops but not offending (.e.g from self-reports). Offending is likely to be a big - but not the only driver - of whether a person has contact with the police.\n\nbecause we do not see U, we must impute its values using probabilities (bets) about the values of U given what we do see (again, X and Y ).",

If instead U represents an unspecified, unknown confounder, then the entire sensitivity exercise will remain far more speculative. Nonetheless, decomposition of the bias factor can still be successful in demonstrating that only implausibly strong confounder or selection effects can account for a strong observed association.

Pina-Sanchez has written about measurement error in crime.\nOne approach is to use Bayesian methods. This is easier said than done! Bayesian methods are extremely flexible and allow the researcher to model to specify a model for the measurement error which is estimated jointly with the model for their outcome. This relies on knowing what the right model for the measurement error should be. It also relies on fitting a Bayesian model to your data which comes with its own set of challenges.\nPina Sanchez gave a workshop on Bayesian adjustments for measurement error, and you can find the materials here[https://josepinasanchez.uk/short-courses/].\nhttps://josepinasanchez.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rmef_measurement-error_b.pdf\nfrom https://josepinasanchez.uk/short-courses/\n\n\nSIMEX\nA less involved option involves assessment measurement error through simulation. The simex R package lets you simulate new versions of your dataset with more and more measurement error. By looking to see how your coefficients change with increasing measurement error you can project backwards to what the coefficients would be with zero measurement error. Neat!\n\n\nrcme\nPina-Sanchez and colleagues have written an R package that can conduct sensitivity analysis for some types of measurement error common to working with police recorded crime.\n\nWork through their example here? https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbc8w\n\nOpen questions - what about survey data?

    "text": "Sometimes when we fit a statistical model we just want to read off a coefficient in the model and that is our key result. However, sometimes we want to calculate some other quantity from our model and focus on that instead. For general applications of this approach see Gelman and Pardoe (2007) and King et al. (2000).\nFor example, Hunter and Tseloni use the results of a fitted regression model to calculate a measure they call ‘Victimization Divide’. This measure is a way to describe how victimization inequality has changed over time - a very important thing for criminologists to care about.\nThis measure is defined as\n(ratio of victimization rates in year 2 - 1) - (ratio of victimization rates in year 2 - 1) / (ratio of victimization rates in year one - 1)\nthis is analagous to exploring the percentage change in victimization inequality between two comparison years.\nHowever, if these ratios of rates come from a statistical model they will also come with some uncertainty measure, such as a standard error. In that case it’s not quite so clear how to incorporate this uncertainty into the calculation of the VD. One way to do this is to use the regression model to simulate a bunch of coefficients values and then calculate the VD for each one.\nMatthews and McVie (2024; see also Matthews 2024) demonstrate this process. The table below shows the prevalence of victimization (for all crime types) for men and women as reported in the Crime Survey for England and Wales for 2015 and 2020 (Office for National Statistics, n.d.). We can see that the prevalence of victimization was higher for men than women in both years, and that it increased for men (by 3.0 percentage points) and women (by 3.6 percentage points) between 2015 and 2020.\nWe can fit a simple regression model to the data in each year to calculate the ratio of the odds of being a victim for men and women. Model 1 shows a statistically significant difference for men (compared to women) in 2015, with men having 11% greater odds of being a victim of crime. In contrast, Model 2 finds that men had a 5% greater odds of being a victim of crime than women in 2020; however, this difference does not meet the 95% threshold for statistical significance.\nCalculating the VD for these two results, based on the odds ratios from the two models, shows that victimization inequality decreased by 52% between the two years. Victimiztion inequality fell by more than half!\nHowever, this does not factor the uncertainty in these odds ratios into our results. To investigate this we can simulate 1,000 sets of coefficients from the models’ results. Using 10,000 simulations from the models’ results, we get 95% intervals for the VD of -0.95 and 0.22. Whilst our most of our simulations do indicate that victimization inequality has declined, this would not be considered ‘statistically significant’ at the usual 95% threshold.\nThe beauty of this simulation approach described by King et al (2000) is that it generalizes to any DQI, such as VD, and to any regression model specification. Say that instead of the VD were interested in the absolute difference in predicted victimization after controlling for other factors (like a marginal effect). Or maybe we have fitted a count model and we want to know the number of people reporting 2 or more victimization incidents - we can calculate this from our simulations whilst incorporating (some) uncertainty into our estimates.\nBut remember that our model is wrong!!
