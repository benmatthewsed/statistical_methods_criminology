# Conclusion

Summary:

- In this workshop I have argued that the key to effective analysis of criminological data lies outside the spreadsheet. 

- We should start our analysis by understanding how our data came to be
- This informs our choice of model
- And how we might choose to account for measurement error, selection effects or omitted variables (or not) in estimates from our models
- And in our choice of theoretical estimands, and how we use model results to come up with estimates of those estimands
- And in how we do our work (using workflow best practices) and how we talk about our results
