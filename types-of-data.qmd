# Types of criminological data

Criminological data - as with criminology itself - is extremely varied. The main types we will focus on in this workshop are self-reported victimization data, and police recorded crime data. Other forms of crime data include other administrative data, such convictions data, arrest data, data on police disposals (such as stop and search), and survey data which may cover things like self-reported offending, or confidence in police. Criminologists may also want to analyse social media data or data scraped from the web. Each of these data sources needs thinking about carefully, and may need different types of analysis depending on things like potential sources of bias or measurement error.

*I guess key point is that you need to know how your data came about to be able to analyse it properly?*

## Who cares about data provenance?

To conduct a useful analysis - the kind that might help you understand the real world - you need to understand how your data came about. As we'll see, whether you are analysing a survey or police recorded crime data or convictions data or something else matters in how you conduct your analysis and interpret the results. You need to know the 'generative story' about your data to analyse it properly.

(cite Betancourt)

## Geography

Mostly scope is national, but not always​

Some local surveys​(suchas MOPAC/Islington Crime Survey)

Can get data on trends for [individual police forces in the UK] (https://data.police.uk/data/), or [victimization survey data aggreted to police division level within Scotland] (https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-scottish-crime-justice-survey/)



## Generative stories for common types of crime data

### How does an event become a crime statistic?

\[add link to SG flow diagram\]

### How does an incident end up as a court record?

Crime​

Arrest and charge​

Court​

Sentencing​

### How does an incident get logged as a police stop?

[@knoxAdministrativeRecordsMask2020a]

-   Observation
-   Encouter
-   Stop

### CVI data?

## Key dilemma

Do official crime statistics reflect ‘behavioural’ trends in crime, or just the actions of the justice system?​(Kitsuse and Cicourel, 1963)

How you see this may depend on your theoretical persuasion [@simesPolicingPunishmentPlace2023]

Sometimes this is less of a dilemma when you have a comparable victim survey and you are interested in overall levels of crime [@buil-gilComparingMeasurementsViolent2022]. However, this is a challenge “outside consolidated western democracies where the range of available data is often limited” [@atakWesternCrimeDrop2020]

## Survey data

Mostly specialist secondary survey​

Scottish Crime and Justice Survey​

Crime Survey for England and Wales​

Equivalents in other countries, primarily in Western Europe, North America and Australasia ​

Smaller geographical scale surveys such as The Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) Survey in London

## Victimization surveys

Typically ask people about their experiences of victimization in the last year​

Can measure crime that isn’t reported to the police​

Usually don’t ask about people’s offending behaviour​

Good for measuring common crimes, bad for measuring rare crimes

## How does a person get selected for the SCJS?

Random sample of 10,000 postcodes in Scotland are contacted to take part​

For those who agree, one adult (age 16 or over) in each household is randomly selected for interview​

Therefore, *by design* no:​

Children​

Homeless people​

People living in communal establishments

“Moreover, in practice, household surveys typically under-represent: those in fragile, disjointed households; slum populations and areas posing security risks.” [@carr-hillMissingMillionsMeasuring2013]

(Not going to talk about things like measurment equivalence in internaitonal surveys although that is a thing!)

Standardization of surveys means it’s hard to reflect new forms of crime in established surveys – see cyber/enabled crime in CSEW​

Regular changes to question wording means that time series analysis is compromised which is why only a small number of fraud and cyber questions were added to the CSEW​

This means that the new questions are only a limited measure of ‘cybercrime’

#### Who is excluded?

For SCJS to be a measure of crime for all adults, not just all adults in private households, we need to make a key assumption that “the subset of the adult population not captured in the SCJS experience the same level of victimisation as adults in the household resident population”​

But this excludes people, students, people in prison, and those living in refuges​

“Domestic abuse is the main cause of women’s homelessness in Scotland… All women living in Women’s Aid refuges have experienced domestic abuse and many will have experienced other forms of crime”
