# Types of criminological data

Criminological data - as with criminology itself - is extremely varied. The main types we will focus on in this workshop are self-reported victimization data, and police recorded crime data. Other forms of crime data include other administrative data, such convictions data, arrest data, data on police disposals (such as stop and search), and survey data which may cover things like self-reported offending, or confidence in police. Criminologists may also want to analyse social media data or data scraped from the web. Each of these data sources needs thinking about carefully, and may need different types of analysis depending on things like potential sources of bias or measurement error.

*I guess key point is that you need to know how your data came about to be able to analyse it properly?*

## Who cares about data provenance?

To conduct a useful analysis - the kind that might help you understand the real world - you need to understand how your data came about. As we'll see, whether you are analysing a survey or police recorded crime data or convictions data or something else matters in how you conduct your analysis and interpret the results. You need to know the 'generative story'[^1] about your data to analyse it properly.

[^1]: 'Generative modelling' is - depressingly - a term that means different things to different audiences [@sankaranGenerativeModelsInterdisciplinary2023]. Michael Betancourt talks about 'narratively generative' models [@betancourtWhatProbabilisticStory], which is a terminology I quite like - we can tell a story about how the data came to be and this can influence the model/s we fit.

When working with criminological data we often know quite a lot about how the data (or if you like, the numbers in the spreadsheet in front of you) came to exist. Using this information - information that might be in metadata, or based on our theoretical knowledge of the world - can help us do better data analysis.

How exactly we incorporate this information will depend a lot on what data we're working with and what the goals of our analysis are. There are no general solutions to what information we should incorporate and how we might do this, but in this workshop we'll cover some scenarios that can arise in criminological research.



## Generative stories for common types of crime data

### How does an event become a crime statistic?

In Scotland there is a very nice discussion of how police recorded crime statistics are put together in the [Scottish Government User Guide to Recorded Crime](https://www.gov.scot/publications/user-guide-recorded-crime-statistics-scotland-3/). We can think of this process as involving four main components:

![Recorded crime](resources/recorded_crime_flowchart.pdf){style="transform: rotate(90deg);"}
- _Reporting_: Most of the time incidents come to the attention of the police after a member of the public reports it. However, we know that not all incidents are reported to the police, and not all people are equally likely to report incidents if they are victims [@fohringPuttingFaceDark2014]
- _Fact-checking/investigation_: Police need to collect initial information about an incident to establish whether a crime has occurred
- _Discretion/judgement_: Even if the police believe a crime has occurred, not all incidents are followed up, for example if a victim chooses not to prosecute or provide details of the perpetrator [@aplinGreyFigureCrime2019]. __Maybe add discussion of [@hopeEffectThirdParty2023] here__?
- _Applying crime counting rules_: This might affect the type of crime an incident is recorded as, including whether it is classed as a hate crime. The current [Scottish Crime Recording Standard](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-crime-recording-standard-crime-recording-counting-rules-2/) is 550 pages long (!). I have not read it.

### Key dilemma

Because of all these processes there has long been a question about the extent to which official crime statistics reflect ‘behavioural’ trends in crime, or just the actions of the justice system [@kitsuseNoteUsesOfficial1963; @hopeEffectThirdParty2023], and how you see this may depend on your theoretical persuasion [@simesPolicingPunishmentPlace2023]. We'll discuss some practical impacts this may have on analysis later in the workshop.


### How does an incident end up as a court record?

We might also want to analyse data on criminal convictions from courts. Here is a high-level overview of how a court record comes to exist in Scotland:

![Court records](resources/court_data_flowchart.pdf){style="transform: rotate(90deg);"}

- _Crime_: All the factors listed above for recorded crime have to happen first
- _Arrest and charge_: The police need to be able to identify the person who committed the offence and charge them with a crime. Incidents disposed of using penalties such as Fixed Penalty Notices or warnings will not reach court
- _Court_: Exactly what a person may end up being convicted for may depend on plea bargaining. In some countries (such as Scotland) court records use the principal offence rule, where only the most serious type of crime included in a set of proceedings is listed. A summary in 2008 found that "eighteen European countries apply a principal offence rule and twenty-one do not apply such a rule".
- _Sentencing_: There is a large literature on sentencing outcomes and how they vary by the characteristics of people being sentenced (see [@pina-sanchezEthnicDisparitiesSentencing2022] for a recent example)

One good thing about using convictions data is that we can be pretty confident (other than in cases such as wrongful conviction) that a crime has occurred. We may be less confident of this using other data sources.


### How does an incident get logged as a police stop?

[@knoxAdministrativeRecordsMask2020a]

-   Observation
-   Encouter
-   Stop

### CVI data?

Sometimes this is less of a dilemma when you have a comparable victim survey and you are interested in overall levels of crime [@buil-gilComparingMeasurementsViolent2022]. However, this is a challenge “outside consolidated western democracies where the range of available data is often limited” [@atakWesternCrimeDrop2020]

## Survey data

In response to known issues with measuring levels of crime with administrative data, since the 1980s criminologists in some parts of the world have been surveying the public to ask about their levels of victimization. 


Scottish Crime and Justice Survey​

Crime Survey for England and Wales​

Equivalents in other countries, primarily in Western Europe, North America and Australasia ​

Smaller geographical scale surveys such as The Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) Survey in London

## Victimization surveys

Typically ask people about their experiences of victimization in the last year​

Can measure crime that isn’t reported to the police​

Usually don’t ask about people’s offending behaviour​

Good for measuring common crimes, bad for measuring rare crimes

## How does a person get selected for the SCJS?

Random sample of 12,000ish postcodes in Scotland are contacted to take part​(for 2020/21 survey it was 12,681 addresses)

For those who agree, one adult (age 16 or over) in each household is randomly selected for interview​

Therefore, *by design* no:​

Children​

Homeless people​

People living in communal establishments

“Moreover, in practice, household surveys typically under-represent: those in fragile, disjointed households; slum populations and areas posing security risks.” [@carr-hillMissingMillionsMeasuring2013]

(Not going to talk about things like measurment equivalence in internaitonal surveys although that is a thing!)

Standardization of surveys means it’s hard to reflect new forms of crime in established surveys – see cyber/enabled crime in CSEW​

Regular changes to question wording means that time series analysis is compromised which is why only a small number of fraud and cyber questions were added to the CSEW​

This means that the new questions are only a limited measure of ‘cybercrime’

#### Who is excluded?

For SCJS to be a measure of crime for all adults, not just all adults in private households, we need to make a key assumption that “the subset of the adult population not captured in the SCJS experience the same level of victimisation as adults in the household resident population”​

But this excludes people, students, people in prison, and those living in refuges​

“Domestic abuse is the main cause of women’s homelessness in Scotland… All women living in Women’s Aid refuges have experienced domestic abuse and many will have experienced other forms of crime”
