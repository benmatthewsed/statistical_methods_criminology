# general linear model{.unnumbered}

# Intro to GLM

# Binary data

- victim or not? offender or not? confident or not?

- [take from gary king]

# Count data

- integers only! stricly positive!

- why not just lm?

- two tribes
  - if all you care about is the average difference then you can just use 'Simple Mean Difference'
  - you might be an economist
  - there are lots of other interesting quesitons we might care about (e.g. modelling dispersion?)
  
- classic problem - over-dispersion

- poisson assumes mean and variance are the same (only one term in the model)
- so what? mostly under-estimates the standard error
- p-values are too optimistic

- you need to think about why your data are over-dispersed

- take from Hilbe (distinct zeros? ZIP; generic solution; NB?)
- ZIP can have different predictors for zeros than count part
- you can also have different predictors for dispersion and rate parameter in NB if you want


- if all you care about is your standard errors you can use quasi-poisson (same point estimates as poisson but with 'empirical' SEs - similar to using robust standard errors)
