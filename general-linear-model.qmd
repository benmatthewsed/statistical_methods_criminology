Introduction to LM

$$
\begin{equation}
y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon
\end{equation}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{align*}
y & : \text{Dependent variable (response)} \\
x_i & : \text{Independent variable (predictor)} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, p \\
\alpha & : \text{Intercept term} \\
\beta_i & : \text{Coefficient for the } i\text{-th predictor} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, p \\
\epsilon & : \text{Error term}
\end{align*}
$$

# Binary data

-   victim or not? offender or not? confident or not?

-   \[take from gary king\]

# Count data

-   integers only! stricly positive!

-   why not just lm?

-   two tribes

    -   if all you care about is the average difference then you can just use 'Simple Mean Difference'
    -   you might be an economist
    -   there are lots of other interesting quesitons we might care about (e.g. modelling dispersion?)

-   classic problem - over-dispersion

-   poisson assumes mean and variance are the same (only one term in the model)

-   so what? mostly under-estimates the standard error

-   p-values are too optimistic

-   you need to think about why your data are over-dispersed

-   take from Hilbe (distinct zeros? ZIP; generic solution; NB?)

-   ZIP can have different predictors for zeros than count part

-   you can also have different predictors for dispersion and rate parameter in NB if you want

-   if all you care about is your standard errors you can use quasi-poisson (same point estimates as poisson but with 'empirical' SEs - similar to using robust standard errors)

## A note on bespoke models


I am extremely partial to bespoke models. If you have the time I would recommend reading and watching all the Statistical Rethinking lectures - this gives an introduction into building your own models tailored to your specific data and problems. But that will take weeks and weeks and we are only here until five.
