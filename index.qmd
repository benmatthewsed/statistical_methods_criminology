# About

This website contains the notes for the course. This is a combination of theoretical discussion and worked examples of fitting statistical models to criminological data and the issues that can arise when doing so.

The worked examples use ode in the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

This website was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) using [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and is rendered with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
