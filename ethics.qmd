# Ethics

## General ethical principles in social science research

In research ethics and governance there is a lot of discussion about informed consent, not disclosing personal information and so on. 

## Reproducible research practices?

Make sure the data is right!!

## Framing

More conceptually, it's important to think about how we frame the results of any analysis.

Three visualizations from [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3)

-   language use

-   providing necessary context?

-   deficit narrative

-   the description of your charts is theoretically informed

## community loss

Jessica Simes [@simesPunishingPlacesGeography2021] gives a good example of how we may want to come up with theoretically informed measures, or theoretically re-frame measures. Simes analysed imprisonment data from the state of Massachusets in the USA, including spatial regression of prison admission rates and how these relate to "racial demographics, social and economic disadvantage, arrest rates, and violent crime" [@simesPlacePunishmentSpatial2018a].

As part of this analysis Simes suggests that the cumulative years sentenced to residents of a particular neighbourhood be thought of as 'community loss'. This is not (just?) an indicator of individual punishment histories, but reflects the chronic and long-term exposure to loss due to imprisonment in different neighbourhoods. This highlights the effects of imprisonment on the communities in which people who end up in prison lived prior to their imprisonment, rather than just focusing on the people who are currently in prison.
