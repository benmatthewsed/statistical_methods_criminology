# Ethics {.unnumbered}

Do no harm!

In research ethics and governance there is a lot of discussion about informed consent, not disclosing personal information and so on.

Sometimes these come up when fitting models to criminological data- UKDS requires that any results you produce don't refer to an unweighted base population of less than 50.

Strictly speaking, this means that if you fit a logistic regression model with a categorical independent variable you need to have more than 50 people in each response category.

This can 


```{r}

library(tidyverse)

set.seed(1234)

n_size <- 5568

# approximate sample size for Scottish Crime and Justice Survey

# The 2011 census found that:
# Scotland's population was 96.0% white

# https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/census-results/at-a-glance/ethnicity/

dat <- tibble(
  ethnicity = sample(c("white scottish/british/other", "minority ethnic"),
       size = n_size,
       prob = c(0.96, 0.04),
       replace = TRUE)
)

# simulate victimization data

dat <- 
dat |> 
  mutate(minority_ethnic = if_else(ethnicity == "minority ethnic", 1, 0),
         vict =
                    rbinom(n = n_size, 
                       size = 1, # either 1 or 0,
                       prob = plogis(-2 +  minority_ethnic * 0.5)))

dat |> 
  count(ethnicity, vict) |> 
  group_by(ethnicity) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))


plogis(-2) # 11%

plogis(-2 + 0.5) # 18% - I just made this up, I don't know if this is accurate!

# if you publish the marginal breakdown by ethnicity in table one

dat |> 
  count(ethnicity)

# and then the regression coefficients

glm(vict ~ ethnicity, family = "binomial", data = dat) |> 
  summary()

# a reader could calculate the probability of victimization using the inverse
# link function and then multiply this by the number of minority ethnic people
# to recover the sample size

plogis(-1.4253) * 227
         
```

This may not apply in every case, but it is worth checking, particularly if you wanted to include things like interaction terms between categorical variables in a logistic regression model.


## Reproducible research practices?






## Framing

More conceptually, it's important to think about how we frame the results of any analysis.

Three visualizations

- language use
- providing necessary context?
- deficit narrative

- the description of your charts is theoretically informed

### community loss

- choosing our measures

- chronic and long-term exposure to loss due to imprisonment

- total person-years lost summed over a geographic area

- more concentrated than imprisonment
